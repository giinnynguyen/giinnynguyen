# Romantic & Math:
 without you, i feel like a null set.... empty <br>
- my love for you is like dividing by zero... it can't be defined ❤️
- are you a 45 degree angle? Because I think you're a-cute 😙
- you're tan(x) and i'm your tangent 😗
- my love for you is like "R"... always real, always infinite 💟
